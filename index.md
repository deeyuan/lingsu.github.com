## Welcome to my simple website

My name is Ling Su and I am a current student from the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
I would like to use this simple website to introduce myself.


### About myself

I moved to United States in 2008 as an exchange student. Soon, I’ve been attracted by American‘s culture. 
It is so diverse and inclusive. So I decide to continue my education in American as an official international student. 

When I first begin to study the MIS, my grades are bad due to my poor English (especially lots of instructors are Indians in my major and they have bad accent). But later, my grades start to get better and better. I am very good at database management and I am very knowledgeable in SQL languages. So I went for applying internship. But unfortunately they didn't hire me although I am as good as others. I guess it’s because the American company has to consider the cost to sponsor my working visa.  It's a setback for me but I didn't give up. I immediately filed the asylum application to US government in order to get the work permit so I can have the same chance as other Americans. 

In spring of 2014, a person found my talent and bought me into the international trading business. I begin to help the company exploring the business throughout the US mainland while I still taking the class in the school. As I was getting busier, I have to reduce the classes I was taking and finally I temporarily left the university for years and just focus on the business. Now I’ve become the partnership and CFO in the company. I’ve successfully manger our company revenue from 10 thousand dollars per months till 1-2 million dollars per months. And company becomes one of the largest luxury auto exporters in the Midwest region of US to China. And I’ve awarded for the permanent residency which I am very proud of. 


### F.Y.I

I am an easy going person and passionate about the urban lifestyle, the move to Chicago was a natural fit. I got a chance to build the wide network between America and China due to the nature of my business. With encouragement from friends and business partners, I began to practice the real estate as well.  In my free time, I love to go hiking with my friends. I also play piano and love to go to concerts. I am fluent in English and Mandarin.
